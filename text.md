1950 - The Turing Test - Alan Turing introduced Turing Test, a test used to evaluate machines ability to mimic/imitate human behavior. This suggested that machine could also learn human behavior influencing future ML researches.

1952 - Computer Checkers - Arthur Samuel made a computer-based checkers program designed to learn automatically from past games/experience. This development marks the first practical use of ML in gaming.

1957 - The Perceptron - Frank Rosenblatt introduced the Perceptron, the first neural network that simulate the thought process of the human brain. This single layer neural network model is capable of recognizing patterns.

1967 - Nearest Neighbor Algorithm - Nearest Neighbor Algorithm start the basic pattern recognition. This algorithm allowed computers to classify data points based on their distance to other point in a given dataset.

1974 - The Backpropagation Algorithm - This algorithm is the turning point for neural networks. The algorithm used a multi-layer network to learn by correcting error through feedback loops.

1979 - The Stanford Cart - The Standford Card is a groundbreaking project in the area of autonomous vehicles. With the use of ML algorithm, the cart automatically navigates obstacles in its environment without human intervention.

1997 - Deep Blue Defeats Man in Chess - In 1997, Deep Blue defeats Garry Kasparov in a game of chess. This proved that a machine can compete against human in terms of intelligence.

2014 - DeepFace - Facebook introduces a facial recognition project called DeepFace. This project use deep learning to identify face with high accuracy showcasing ML's potential for the advancement of computer vision.

2010s Onward - GenAI - With the rise of Generative AI models such as GPT. These models generates text, image, video, and music based on the users input.
